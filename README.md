🚕 NYC Taxi Trip Duration
End-to-End MLOps Project

This project implements a production-ready end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting NYC Taxi Trip Duration, including data processing, feature engineering, model training, versioning, containerization, CI/CD, and deployment using Docker, Kubernetes, and Seldon Core.


📌 Problem Statement

Given pickup and drop-off locations along with time information, predict the expected taxi trip duration (in seconds).

This is a regression problem based on the NYC Taxi Trip Duration dataset.

✨ Key Highlights

✅ Modular data pipeline (Cookiecutter style)

✅ Advanced feature engineering

✅ XGBoost model for regression

✅ DVC for data & model versioning

✅ FastAPI for model serving

✅ Docker containerization

✅ Kubernetes deployment

✅ Seldon Core (optional)

✅ GitHub Actions CI pipeline
